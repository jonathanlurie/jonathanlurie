### Hi, I'm Jonathan and I like to code things.
(it also happens to be my job)

- 🗺️ I’m currently a senior dev working on SDK and graphics rendering of maps at [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/), especially related to weather data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about weather science and data format, GIS things and WebGPU
- 💬 Ask me about scientific data processing and visualization on the web, shader, signal processing, web stuff and maps
